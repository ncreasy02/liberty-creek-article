    <h2>Liberty Creek High Principal Faces Backlash Over Prioritizing Aesthetics Over Student Safety</h2>
    <p><strong>Hendersonville, TN</strong> – Liberty Creek High School's principal, Phillip Holt, has come under fire after a controversial decision to remove a "No Guns" sign from the school's front entrance. The principal, celebrated for his eye for detail and fierce school pride, reportedly took down the sign after noticing that it lacked the school's wolf logo and signature navy and red colors.</p>
    <p>The move has sparked outrage among some community members, who say that aesthetics shouldn’t take precedence over student safety. “The sign may not have had our mascot, but it got the message across,” one concerned parent said. “We’re all for school spirit, but this seems like a step too far.”</p>
    <p>According to sources, Holt has consistently focused on aligning every element on campus to showcase the “Liberty Creek brand,” which he claims “brings unity and pride to the student body.” However, critics argue that swapping out safety signs until they’re more “on brand” is a stretch—even for Liberty Creek’s biggest fan.</p>
    <p>In a statement to The Hendersonville Standard, Holt explained his reasoning. “When students walk onto this campus, they should feel like they’re stepping into a carefully curated wolf den,” he said. “Everything should reflect our colors, our values, and our spirit—including our safety signage.”</p>
    <p>The Standard reached out to Liberty Creek’s cheer coach, Ashley Pascarella, who, in a lighthearted jab, remarked, “If Principal Holt wants pointers on school pride, I might just have a few winning ideas.”</p>
    <p>While some parents have started an online petition to reinstate the original “No Guns” sign immediately, others have suggested a compromise: a replacement sign featuring a howling wolf alongside the safety message.</p>
    <p>Whether this sign redesign will move forward remains to be seen, but one thing is clear—Principal Holt’s vision for Liberty Creek is as bold as ever. As one parent noted, “It’s one thing to show school spirit, but maybe let’s leave the safety signs out of the makeover.”</p>
